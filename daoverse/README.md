# Daoverse

## Overview
**Daoverse** is the capstone project for the **Turbin3 Q1 '25 Builders Cohort**. It is a decentralized platform that enables the creation and management of DAOs. The program is designed to support three different types of users: **Admins**, **DAO Creators**, and **DAO Members**.

## Features
### 1. Admin
Admins oversee the platform and perform key administrative functions such as:
- **initialize_daoverse** ‚Äì Initializes the Daoverse platform.
- **admin_deposit** ‚Äì Deposits funds into the Daoverse treasury.
- **update_daoverse** ‚Äì Updates the Daoverse configuration.

### 2. DAO Creators
DAO creators establish DAOs within Daoverse. Their key functions include:
- **validate_creator** ‚Äì Ensures a user meets the requirements to become a DAO creator.
- **pay_daoverse_fee** ‚Äì Pays the required fee to gain eligibility as a DAO creator.
- **create_dao** ‚Äì Creates a DAO for eligible users.
- **update_dao** ‚Äì Updates DAO configurations.

### 3. DAO Members
DAO members participate in governance and decision-making within a DAO. They function in three key roles:

#### 3.1 DAO Member - General
- **validate_member** ‚Äì Checks if the user is a valid DAO member.
- **initialize_member** ‚Äì Registers the user as a DAO member.
- **update_member** ‚Äì Allows a DAO member to update their configuration.

#### 3.2 DAO Member - As a Proposer
- **validate_proposer** ‚Äì Ensures that a member is eligible to propose projects.
- **create_proposal** ‚Äì Enables an eligible member to submit a proposal.

#### 3.3 DAO Member - As a Voter
- **validate_voter** ‚Äì Verifies the member as a voter.
- **cast_vote** ‚Äì Records a member's vote, updates the proposal account, and transfers tokens to the staking vault.

#### 3.4 DAO Member - As a Reward Claimer
- **finalize_proposal** ‚Äì Distributes rewards to stakers after voting concludes.
- **claim_rewards** ‚Äì Allows participants to reclaim staked tokens along with a reward percentage.

## Deployment & Testing

### Deployment to Devnet
After deploying, the Daoverse program is available at:
```
Program Id: 2DCZ8tfm5Jj4GVLyGVqygQYGsZSxrWUMYdrZT8KJ1Ad4
Owner: BPFLoaderUpgradeab1e11111111111111111111111
ProgramData Address: F43BqM3gAjB6AF5jFJVjeTnNhFLZTVU8NYEaJaqbNcLM
Authority: 8Jwcot83CBXzAj1a7HEn1C8F6yymstKNjxUBpUEyRYqz
Last Deployed In Slot: 363968457
Data Length: 454720 (0x6f040) bytes
Balance: 3.16605528 SOL
```

### Running Tests
To run tests locally:
```sh
solana-test-validator  # Start a local Solana blockchain
solana airdrop 10      # (Optional) Airdrop SOL to your account
solana balance         # Check your balance

anchor build
anchor deploy --provider.cluster localnet

anchor test
```
For testing on **Devnet**, modify `Anchor.toml`:
```toml
[provider]
cluster = "Devnet"
wallet = "~/.config/solana/id.json"
```
Then deploy the program again:
```sh
solana program show 2DCZ8tfm5Jj4GVLyGVqygQYGsZSxrWUMYdrZT8KJ1Ad4
```

## Test Results
Below is a summary of key test cases executed:

### ‚úÖ Successfully Executed Tests
- Initializes Daoverse and fetches treasury balance.
- Updates Daoverse configuration successfully.
- Prevents unauthorized updates.
- Creates a DAO and updates DAO configurations.
- Initializes DAO members and prevents initialization with insufficient funds.
- Submits valid proposals and rejects invalid ones.
- Records votes, prevents duplicate voting, and ensures sufficient staking funds.
- Distributes rewards correctly and prevents double claiming.

### ‚ùå Expected Failures (Correctly Handled)
- Unauthorized config updates.
- Unauthorized DAO updates.
- DAO member initialization with insufficient funds.
- Invalid proposal creation.
- Voting with insufficient tokens.
- Duplicate voting.
- Unauthorized reward claims.

Total **20 passing tests** in **14s**. Complete execution in **16.34s**.

## Conclusion
Daoverse provides a robust foundation for decentralized governance. With clear role-based permissions, secure proposal voting, and a staking-based incentive system, it ensures transparency and fairness in DAO operations. üöÄ
